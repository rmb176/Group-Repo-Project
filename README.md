# Group-Repo-Project


Our program takes input from the user. This input is their name and age. 

A string is returned with their name and age in a cheeky statement written by
programmer Scott.

Installation: This program is an .exe file so you should notice it start running immediately. If it does not, go to our help page: ScottCanHelp.com

Usage:

-The program will ask for users name, followed by age. 
-The program will ouput "Hello (blank) you are (blank) years old.
-ERROR: If str is not entered for name and int is not entered for age, program will fail to run.

```python
name = str(input("What is your name? "))
age = int(input("What is your age?"))
print(name, "you are ", age," and you are not getting any younger!")
```
